# Discover-Greece
WebApp Project for Year 3, Semester 1, CMP306

This is a website I made for coursework purposes. It has the following attributes:

-Based on some HTML5 framework such as Bootstrap

-Holds the site data within a MySQL database.

-Uses an API to deliver data to and from the database in JSON or XML format

-Allows for user sessions.

-Provides a secure Login for users.

-Built using an MVC framework.

-Includes some live data from an IoT device. (This may refer to data that does not match the site subject matter!)

-IoT data accessible via JQueryMobile.

-Provides an XML feed for some of the data.

-Consumes some external RSS feed via XSL.

-Includes a REST Web Service.
