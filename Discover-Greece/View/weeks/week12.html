<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Week 12</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The REST service in the present website works by utilising the MVC design that was implemented in the previous weeks. The user can access a page with three links, one for getting all items, one for getting an item with a given id and one for creating an item . These links access the items.php page in the control folder which decides what method was used to access that file. If POSTwas used, then the createItem() method , in the model folder, will be used to send the input data to the database and create the desired item. If GETwas used with a given id, then the getItemById($id) will be used, using the item id given. If no id was given then the getAllItems() function will be used. The result data is then displayed to the user. In order to test whether the service worked, all functions were tested and through the files and the URL field of the browser and the results were confirmed with the data in the database. For example if the createItem() function was used, the database was then checked to ensure that the item with the given data was indeed created.</span></p>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The REST service should be altered to ensure that only specific users can use it to protect the data in the database. This can be done by granting unique access tokens to the users that want to access the service and then use those tokens to determine whether the user trying to access it should be allowed to use the service.</span></p>
