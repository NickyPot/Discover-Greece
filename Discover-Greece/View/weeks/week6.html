<p><br />The aim of the MVC(Model View Controller) methodology is to separate what each part of a piece of software does. All files in the View folder control what the user sees. In the Control folder, the files handle user interaction with the application and in the Model folder the files handle the business logic, as in what data needs to be submitted or retrieved. This separation of data and user interface allows changing one aspect of the application, without affecting the other aspects in a drastic way, which is vital in a professional environment where requirements change is very common.</p>
<p>Development can benefit in many ways by utilising the MVC methodology. Firstly, multiple developers can work on the same project concurrently, as the different parts of the project using MVC don&rsquo;t affect each other. Secondly, by using MVC the development costs can be reduced dramatically. As MVC allows for reusing code in different parts of the application, developers do not have to rewrite code to do the same thing, thus reducing the required development time and cost of a project. Another big advantage of MVC is the increased readability of the code, as a piece of code only has one function rather than handling multiple functions of the application.</p>

<p><br />As seen in the diagram above, there is pattern to how the code works in the remote procedure call protocol. The user makes a request which is then handled by the control portion of the application. The control then decided which function needs to be called in order to satisfy the user&rsquo;s request. Then the model portion communicates with the database, which responds with the desired data. The data is the converted into a JSON string, which is passed to the control. That JSON string is then given to the view which is what the user of the application sees.<br />However in order for this structure to work, the developer has to have some knowledge about the data that is going to be received. For example, the developer needs to know what kind of columns the database (column names and datatypes) table has and if they accept null values or not. Especially in the case of varchar type columns, the developer needs to know how big the data can be, so that the column does not reject the createEmployee function for example.</p>
