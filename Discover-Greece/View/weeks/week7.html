<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Week 7</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program on the electric imp collect the internal and external temperature (measured in Celsius), as well as the voltage (measured in Volts) and light level (measured in lux) of the room. The electric imp collects the raw data from the sensor on the board and process it using the necessary calculations in order to convert it to the proper units. That data is then sent the electricimp.com developer console, where it is then displayed, in order for the developer to see and verify that they are the correct values. In order to make sure that these values where indeed correct, a few measures were taken. Firstly, the code was testes on multiple different electric imp devices, in order to make sure that the sensors on the devices were not faulty. Then, for the external temperature, which is the room temperature, a thermometer, unrelated to the device was used, in order to make sure that the temperature displayed by the electric imp was correct. For the voltage and the light level no tested was conducted, as it would require a light meter and a multimeter, which were not found in the lab. As for the internal temperature, an infrared thermometer could be used to verify the readings, however this was also not attainable during the testing of the project.</span></p>
