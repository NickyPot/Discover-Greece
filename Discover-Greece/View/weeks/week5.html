<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Week 5</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were multiple measures that were implemented to make the user registration and user login form safe. Firstly, a captcha form, provided by Google, was implemented. This captcha form needs to be completed first, in order to submit the registration/login form. This prevents any hackers using a bot to bruteforce multiple login patterns, making hacking the website more time consuming. In addition to this, an email validation was implemented to make sure that the email implemented was in the correct format, with the use of a regular expression. This prevents the user from inputting text in that specific field that does not conform with the email address standard. As a result, cross site scripting would be a lot more difficult to achieve through that field for example. Furthermore, password validation, was used to make the form more secure. The user has to choose a password that includes at least one number, one special character from the ones provided, one capital and one small letter. That password then has to be entered again in the next field to make sure it is the same. This way the user is unable to input any kind of text they want as it has to conform to the standard set by the developer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One security feature that adds to the safety of the website is the encryption of passwords using bcrypt. By using the functions provided by php, when a user registers their password is encrypted. The output string is never the same and it is next to impossible to brute force it as it is not reversible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another feature that adds to the security of the website is the use of prepared statements. This way any inputs made by the user cannot have any negative effects on the database as they are sent using a different protocol. This helps greatly in the prevention of SQL Injections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One area where the website is weak security wise, is the use of only one user for database interactions. As only one user was provided by the university to interact with the database, this cannot be avoided. In an ideal scenario, different users would be created to interact with the database, with different writing and reading privileges to different tables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, an area where the website could improve would be the use of random names for columns in the database. Although, this would make development with the database a little bit more difficult, in the case of a breach in the database, the hacker would not be able to know what information is contained in each column.</span></p>
