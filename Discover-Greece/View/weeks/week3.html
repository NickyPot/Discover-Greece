<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Week 3</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The getAllItems() method works as follows: first the server makes a connection with the database, using the connection.php file, which is located in the model folder. Then the connection details are passed on to the api-items.php file, also in the model folder, where the function is located. The function gets all the items and the relevant information, such as image addresses, articles, etc and returns all that information in the form of a JSON string. Finally, that&nbsp; JSON string is passed on to the show-items.php file, for example, which is then decoded to get the information in the form of a simple string. There a loop is used to iterate through the available items and display the relevant information. This can be done on any file, anywhere on the server, without rewriting all the function, because of the use of the API.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structuring data retrieval in the form of an API is a very good way to make those functions portable. It allows the web application to be very portable and flexible, which is very important, especially in the current world of technology, where sudden changes are very common.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, should the owner of a website decide to change where the database is located, only one file needs to be changed (connection.php), in order for the website to keep working properly. If an API was not used during the creation of the application, every single file where database functions where used would need to be changed, which would add unnecessary time to development and add unwanted costs, should this happen in a professional environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example of the benefits of the use of an API, would be security. As the critical information of the connection to the database (username, password, server address) are only present in one file, this allows for that file to be closed off from unwanted access. This can be done by relocating that file outside the web root folder. This way, the application files that are on the server can still access it, but hackers would have a harder time gaining access to it.</span></p>
