<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though multiple measures were taken to make the website as secure as possible, no website or application in general is completely secure. Especially in the case of an E-commerce website, extra security measures would have to be implemented. One of the biggest weaknesses of the website in its current state is that the connection file that allows the server to connect to the database is accessible from the web. As a result, in the case of an e-commerce website, that file along with all the api files would be relocated to a place on the server, where gaining access to them would be a lot more difficult, without sufficient security clearance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another flaw in the website that could be improved is encryption of data. As it stands, only passwords are encrypted in the database. This makes the passwords relatively safe in the case of a data breach, but the email addresses and phone numbers would be vulnerable. In the case of the e-commerce website all user data would be encrypted to improve security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, by using a standardised login system, the security of the website could be improved greatly. A very good example of this is OAuth. OAuth is a system any website can use to grant user access to its content without storing critical user data. The user can use their login credentials from big companies such as Google and Facebook, that would almost definitely have better security than most smaller websites. This way, an e-commerce would not only be able to cut down on development costs, as they would not have to develop their own security measures, but also make the website safer. However, should a user not have an account with Google, Facebook or any other OAuth company, they would not be able to use the e-commerce website.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defining a session timeout length would improve the security of the website and this can be done by having a session variable where the start time of the session is stored. Then in another variable the time of the last user activity can be stored. Then these two variables can be compared and if the time of the last interaction has exceeded the time limit since the start of the session, the session can be destroyed and the user would be asked to login again to make sure that it is still the same person using the website.</span></p>
