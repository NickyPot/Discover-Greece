<h1>Week 1</h1>
<ol class="c42 lst-kix_6k4xtqm1a4al-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c6 c38"><span class="c0">Bootstrap gives developers 12 columns to use that span the page. These columns can be grouped together to create bigger ones, which gives a lot of flexibility in the design of a website, as the developer can create websites that look vastly different, even though they all use the same grid system. Lastly, Bootstrap allows the developer to change the column layout of the website, based on the screen that it is being viewed on. For example, one can utilise a 12 column layout on devices with bigger screens such as desktop and &nbsp;a 3 column layout on smaller screen devices such as smartphones. This feature makes a website highly responsive and usable on almost any device.</span></li><li class="c1 c6 c38"><span class="c0">The main menu in the website will be the navigation bar, that will be present in every page of the website. Bootstrap provides tools for making the navigation bar responsive, in order for it to be usable on any device. In addition, there might be cases where dropdown menus are required to make navigating the website easier. Bootstrap also provides a dropdown menu element that can be further customised to fit the theme of the website. Lastly, another menu that will be implemented will be the login and registration menu. This will be a floating menu area, that will adjust its placement based on the screen size it is being viewed on.</span></li><li class="c1 c6 c38"><span class="c0">Firstly, the card element from bootstrap will help greatly in making this website. It will help create an attractive layout for the different items that will be displayed on the website and make it easier for the user to pick which item they want to view. Secondly, the Bootstrap button element will help will help with displaying the available articles for each item in an easy to navigate manner. Thirdly, the form elements from Bootstrap will help with creating attractive forms, that the user can use to either submit a comment, register or login to the website. In addition, panels will be used to make a clear distinction to the user of the different areas in the website. Lastly, image classes will be used for the images for articles and items. This will allow for a more aesthetically pleasing display of images, that will help catch the attention of the user.</span></li></ol>
