<h3>Things to do on Rhodes</h3>
<h4>  Old Town: priceless global heritage</h4>
<p>One of the best preserved mediaeval settlements in the world, the Old Town has been declared a Unesco World Heritage Site, and is one of the many reasons to choose Rhodes as your holiday destination.

<p>  Cosmopolitan Mandraki
A modern city, with a shopping centre, large hotels and resorts, numerous cafes, restaurants, clubs, impressive sights and attractions, but also traditional villas called marasiotika (from Marasia).
