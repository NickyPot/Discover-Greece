<h3>The symbol of the city of Thessaloniki</h3>

<p>Built on top of a Byzantine fortification around the 15th century, the White Tower was enclosed by defensive walls and served as a fort to strengthen the port and the coastline’s defenses. At that time, it was called the Lion Tower, in honor of the Ottoman military victory, while in the 17th century, it became known as the Tower of Kalamaria. Repurposed as a garrison and then a prison, it then took on the name of the Tower of Blood (or Kanli Kule in Turkish). It was in 1891 when it received its current name of White Tower and was painted white.</p>

<p>In the 20th century, the defensive walls were destroyed, while the tower served as a communication center for the Allied forces in World War I. Many ancient artifacts were also stored inside during the conflicts. From 1912 to 1983, the tower housed the air defense of Thessaloniki and also accommodated the university’s meteorological laboratory. Today, the tower is open to the public and is home to a museum focusing on Thessaloniki’s rich history and its multicultural spirit. Visitors can also enjoy impressive vistas from the highest level.</p>
